# PayDay
## Riri
let's do different colored tiles
the events will be yellow tiles
pay day will be green tiles
red will be the loan shark
blue will be starting point
or like you need ideas for events

## Events
- Invest in stonks
- loan shark - 10,000
- payday - 5, 11, 17, and 23rd (+) tile (kailangan lang madaanan ng player)

## To wife or to not wife
- 2nd loop grants the player a choice: "To wed or not to wed"
- Marrying gives the player 50,000, with the caveat being your spouse has a 50/50 chance of leaving you at the end of the game with half your money
	- kids will add 2% to the chances of your spouse staying

## To child or to not child
- 3rd loop grants the player a choice: "To child or to not child"
- How many kids is decided on a dice roll, e.g: rolling 4 will give you 4 kids. Kids are expensive creatures, it costs 5k per child
- Once a player gets to the final amount (500,000), the kids get added to your net-worth, with 10k a kid.

## To College or to not College and Job 
Explain to player that while college takes 1 loop aroud the board, you are provided with better jobs after they "graduate".

job opportunities aren't created equal: different jobs earn more than others

layoff rare event - Player will "reroll" their job and pick again from their corresponding job pool

Separate events and jobs pool for college and starting with a job

### College
- Finish college after 1 loop
- Events pay weaker
- get a career with a high paying job after "graduation"

### Start with a job
- different job pool, with lesser paying jobs than college job pool
- player picks 2 cards from 3 unkown. He then picks 1 from the pair he picked earlier and that becomes his job. 
- The job they can pick from only pays decent money


## Win Conditions
- The game ends once a player reaches 500,000
	- this is where we do calculations based on the player's decisions (if they had kids, or if they wed)
